# Inspector-Plus
Inspector+ is a tool that separates the Components of your GameObjects into tabs and helps you see the Components in the tab you want. Programmed by tzdevil.

# How to use Inspector+?
You can add Inspector+ to your project by going to **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from Git URL** and entering https://github.com/tzdevil/Inspector-Plus.git <br />
You can then access Inspector+ via Window > General > Inspector+. I advise you to pin it near your Inspector.

## This tool is still experimental and unintended things may happen, use it with caution and at your own risk.
